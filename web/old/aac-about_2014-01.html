<h2>
Performance and Composition
</h2>

<p>
I am an active pianist as well as an organist, choral conductor, and composer.
I direct <a href="quilisma.html">Quilisma</a>, a weekly time for singing Gregorian chant at the University of Chicago.

<p>
I have worked as music director of churches in Indiana, and as a substitute organist in Chicago.
I have also taught private piano, organ, and theory lessons.
My recitals have integrated solo piano, organ, and harpsichord performances with chamber music and original compositions and improvisations. 
My compositions include concert music and church music for chorus, as well as songs and piano pieces. 

<h2>
Musicology Research
</h2>

<p>
My dissertation is entitled “Faith, Hearing, and the Power of Music in Hispanic Villancicos, 1600–1700.”
My article, “Playing Cards at the Eucharistic Table: Music, Theology, and Society in a Corpus Christi Villancico from Colonial Mexico, 1628,” is forthcoming in the <i>Journal of Early Modern History</i>.

<p>
My current research uses seventeenth-century villancicos (a widespread genre of vocal sacred music based on vernacular poetry) as sources for historical theological understandings of the power of music. 
I consider how this both popular and cultivated form of devotion fit into the evangelizing and civilizing mission of the Spanish church and state, particularly in the villancico cycles by Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla at the cathedral of Puebla de los Ángeles, Mexico.
Through musical analysis I hope to discover the details of composing and performing music reflected broader concepts of music's place in the cosmos and its effect on the human body through the senses and affections.
I ground my interpretations in early modern music-theoretical and theological literature and visual art.
