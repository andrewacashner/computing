<h1>
Welcome
</h1>

<p>
I am a musician and scholar of music.
</p>

<p>
My current research focuses on devotional music of early modern Mexico and Spain, especially villancicos.
The value of my research has been recognized by fellowships from the American Council of Learned Societies, the American Musicological Society, the Council for European Studies at Columbia University, and the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Chicago.
My article “Playing Cards at the Eucharistic Table: Music, Theology, and Society in a Corpus Christi Villancico from Colonial Mexico, 1628” was published in the <cite>Journal of Early Modern History</cite>, vol. 18, no. 4 (2014).
My dissertation, supported by a Mellon/ACLS Dissertation Completion Fellowship, is entited “Faith, Hearing, and the Power of Music in Hispanic Villancicos, 1600—1700.”
</p>

<p>
I am active as a pianist and organist.
