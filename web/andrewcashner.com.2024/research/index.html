        <p>
        My publications in the field of music studies (musicology) present my original research on religious music in early modern Spain and Mexico, music in the history of science and computing, and other topics.
        I pursue a holistic approach to understanding how structures of musical sound are linked to structures of society. 
        I am interested in the ways that people enact their fundamental beliefs through music, especially the ways we use song to connect with each other and the divine. 
        I am also interested in how we use and abuse music as a tool of power. I want to find ways to use teaching, research, and performance to undo systems of oppression and build a just society. 
        </p>
        <p>
        These questions have motivated my research into Christian devotional music of the Spanish Empire (<a href="../villancicos/index.html"><em>villancicos</em></a>) and the traditional songs and dances of the Onöndowa’ga:’ (Seneca) Nation on whose land I live and work.
        I am also interested in colonial music and intercultural exchange, constructions of race and power, hearing practices, oral traditions, hermeneutics (interpretation), antiracist pedagogy, and digital-humanities methods.
        My work has been supported and recognized by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Council of Learned Societies, the US Department of Education, and the American Musicological Society.

                  <p class="abstract">
                  <cite>Hearing Faith</cite> explores the ways Roman Catholics
                  in the seventeenth-century Spanish Empire used music to
                  connect faith and hearing. 
                  From the Royal Chapel in Madrid to Puebla Cathedral in
                  colonial Mexico, communities celebrated Christmas and other
                  feasts with villancicos, a widespread genre of vernacular
                  poetry and devotional music. 
                  A large proportion of villancico texts directly address the
                  nature of hearing and the power of music to connect people to
                  God.  
                  By interpreting complex and fascinating examples of <q>music
                    about music</q> in the context of contemporary theological
                  writing, the book shows how Spanish Catholics embodied their
                  beliefs about music, through music itself. 
                  Listening closely to these previously undiscovered and
                  overlooked archival sources reveals how Spanish subjects
                  listened and why.

                        Cashner’s book is <strong>the most comprehensive and accessible
                          overview to date in English of the importance and
                          sophistication of the [villancico] genre during the
                          seventeenth century.</strong> [...]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Cashner’s arguments here are carefully and thoroughly
                        documented through primary materials closely associated with
                        Spanish religious writing; his <strong>stylistically insightful
                          musical analysis</strong> explicates how composers deployed
                        sophisticated musical-expressive devices to shape their
                        villancicos through sometimes subtle variants to established
                        genre-convention. [...] <strong>He is careful to frame his close
                          readings with clear and compelling introductions and
                          conclusions</strong> to his case studies, which effectively
                        convey the significance of each instance and help the reader
                        understand how these disparate cases share essential
                        characteristics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I will eagerly use this book in my teaching and will encourage
                        rising scholars to draw on it as <strong>a model of careful and
                          compelling interdisciplinary work.</strong>

                        A concise and polished book with an interpretive approach to
                        music, <cite>Hearing Faith</cite> will be especially appealing
                        for experienced musicologists in the field of villancicos and
                        for scholars interested more broadly in Latin American
                        colonial music or curious about the fascinating intersections
                        between music and religion.  The book provides an insight into
                        musical composition and performance as a way to enhance the
                        faithfuls’ understanding of theological notions and thus
                        achieve spiritual transcendence.

                        <p>
                        <cite>Hearing Faith</cite> proposes a fresh perspective on the
                        intellectual and serious side of the repertoire, which has
                        been less examined than its comic or transgressive aspects.
                        <strong>Among the book’s strengths is that it brings attention to the
                          relevance of hearing for Catholicism in the seventeenth
                          century.</strong> [...] It has been argued that hearing was the center
                        of worship for Protestants [...].  Instead, sight and touch
                        were the privileged senses for Catholics [...].  <cite>Hearing
                          Faith</cite> calls this assumption into question by
                        <strong>offering a glimpse into the sophisticated aural
                          culture of Spanish and colonial Mexican Catholics</strong>,
                        which was firmly rooted in Christian Neoplatonic philosophy.

                        Musicology has largely ignored the villancico, a few notable
                        exceptions notwithstanding [...].  The genre’s sources are
                        widely dispersed and poorly catalogued, and critical editions,
                        performances, and recordings are relatively scarce. <strong>The
                          interpretative rewards however, as skillfully demonstrated in
                          Cashner’s intense and polished study, are rich.</strong>

                        <p>
                        Since Cashner’s book is substantially based on these otherwise
                        inaccessible works, the online edition [in the <cite>Web
                          Library of Seventeenth-Century Music</cite>] serves as an
                        invaluable companion to
                        Cashner’s monograph. <cite>Hearing Faith</cite> expands the
                        online corpus and subjects their texts and musical settings to
                        intense scrutiny, always relating the works and their
                        performance to the broader theological climate from which they
                        emerged and to which they may have contributed.

                        <p>
                        Cashner exposes the precise mechanisms employed by poets and
                        composers in the creation of their works. <strong>It is as if
                          he takes us into their studios and allows us to observe
                          their creative decisions.</strong> The villancicos emerge as
                        surprisingly complex works that depend on the twin discourses
                        of theology and music as complementary ways of knowing. [...]
                        <strong>Cashner combines forensic musical and textual analysis to
                          reveal the villancico as an unexpected site for theological
                          discourse</strong> and in doing so opens the way for the much
                        more comprehensive study of music as theology in the vast
                        Spanish empire that his title invites.

                        [...]
                        Multiple musical settings of the same villancico text on the subject of music, especially, not only illuminate the networks between composers of villancicos but also display the variety of practices for representing the musical ideas of the texts, with composers thus demonstrating their mastery of <q>musical-theological tropes.</q>

                  The music-notation software Lilypond generates high-quality music typography from a plain-text input format; almost every aspect of the program can be customized and programmed, and the system lends itself well to automation and batch processing. Lilypond offers a <q>minimal computing</q> alternative to bloated, costly, and hegemonic graphical programs. 
                  Like many free software tools, however, Lilypond still exacts a cost in time and training needed to overcome an unwieldly interface and adapt the tool for scholarly purposes. 
                  The author developed a system called <code>lirio</code> that enabled the production of two critical editions and a monograph in Lilypond (integrated with LaTeX). 
                  The system provides a new semantic-markup interface to Lilypond that enables scholars to think about typography separately from musical content; a range of expanded Lilypond functionality including incipit staves, mensural coloration brackets, and editorial annotations; and a stricter input format that makes Lilypond files easier to maintain. 
                  The author also developed the prototype <code>ly2mei</code> compiler to demonstrate how Lilypond files can be converted to MEI-XML, overcoming a major limitation in Lilypond’s export abilities. 
                  The article argues that scholars will be best served by a simple, consistent, meaningful interface in a format that can be shared and converted. 
                  An extension of Lilypond like <code>lirio</code> demonstrates the considerable potential of this tool for enterprising and patient scholars whose needs are not met by other tools. 
                  Lilypond provides a case study for how to make open-source, free-license tools work for our own needs as digital humanists.

                  <p class="abstract">
                  In Book Eight of Athanasius Kircher’s <cite>Musurgia universalis</cite> (Rome, 1650), this Jesuit polymath describes a computing device for automated music composition, called the Arca musarithmica.
                  A new software implementation of Kircher’s device in Haskell, a pure-functional programming language, demonstrates that the Arca can be made into a completely automatic computational system. 
                  Moreover, the project also demonstrates that the Arca in its original form already constituted a computational system that almost completely automatic though designed to be operated by a human user: as Kircher advertised, a completely <q>amusical</q> user could generate music simply by using the device according to his rules. 
                  The device itself served as a microcosm of Kircher’s goal in the Musurgia to encapsulate and codify all musical knowledge, and demonstrate that music manifested the underlying mathematical order of the Creation and its Creator. 
                  This article analyses the concepts and methods of computation in Kircher’s original system, in dialogue with the interpretation of his system in software. 
                  The Arca musarithmica, now available on the web, makes it possible actually to hear how well Kircher was able to reduce seventeenth-century music to algorithmic rules. 
                  The successes of the system are inseparable from many paradoxical elements that raises broader questions about how Kircher and his contemporaries understood the links between composition and computation, mathematics and rhetoric, traditional harmonic theory and emerging tonal practice, and concepts of <q>invention</q> and authorship.

                  <p class="abstract">
                  Athanasius Kircher (1602—1680) described in <cite>Musurgia
                    universalis</cite> (1650) a device for automatic music
                  composition called the <em>Arca musarithmica</em>, and at least
                  three physical implementations of the Arca survive in the UK and
                  the rest of Europe.
                  While Kircher’s general influence on the lettered elite of the
                  Spanish Empire, including Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, has been well
                  established, this article presents the first evidence that anyone
                  in the realms of Spain actually tried to use the Arca. 
                  Two manuscript miscellanies—one created in Puebla around 1695 and
                  the other in Madrid around 1785—include abridged versions of the
                  Arca musarithmica. 
                  The source from Puebla’s Biblioteca Palafoxiana, I argue,
                  constitutes a partial but functional implementation of the device—a
                  fourth surviving Arca. 
                  The collection also opens a window into the preoccupations of
                  Kircher enthusiasts in New Spain: it includes geometrical notes on
                  trisecting the angle alongside accounting records for the Church’s
                  tithe tax (<em>diezmos</em>) and writings on engineering, alchemy,
                  ancient chronology, architecture, and other topics that were seen
                  at the time as aspects of mathematics.
                  But if the Arca in 1690s Puebla furthered a quest for universal
                  knowledge, the Madrid source from a century later reflects an
                  amateur’s bungling effort to make sense of Kircher’s complex
                  system, and suggests that by the end of the eighteenth century the
                  Arca was seen as more of a curiosity.

                  <p class="abstract">
                  A few months before Christmas in 1678, Miguel de Irízar, the
                  thrifty chapelmaster of Segovia Cathedral, made a notebook out of
                  a pile of his received letters, drafting music on the margins of
                  letters from other musicians about the exchange of music and
                  poetry.  This article examines Irízar’s output of villancicos for
                  Segovia, including works written for specific local devotional
                  practices, and, through a codicological analysis and sketch study
                  of his letter-notebook of 1678, reconstructs the chapelmaster’s
                  compositional process. Irízar adapted and rearranged the texts
                  he received in correspondence to tailor a coherent cycle for his
                  own community. Based on a new edition of the first villancico in
                  the 1678 cycle, the article analyses Irízar’s use of musical
                  conventions and practical craftsmanship in producing music that
                  suited his ensemble and congregation. Villancicos served as a
                  point of intersection for local and global aspects of both music
                  and devotion.

                  <p class="abstract">
                  Church ensembles of Spaniards across the Spanish Empire regularly
                  impersonated African and other non-Castilian characters in the
                  villancicos they performed in the Christmas Matins liturgy.
                  Although some scholars and performers still mistakenly assume that
                  ethnic villancicos preserve authentic Black or Native voices, and
                  others have critiqued them as Spaniards’ racist caricatures, there
                  have been few studies of the actual music or of specific local
                  contexts. This article analyzes Al establo más dichoso (At the
                  happiest stable), an ensaladilla composed by Juan Gutiérrez de
                  Padilla for Christmas 1652 at Puebla Cathedral. In this
                  performance his ensemble impersonated an array of characters
                  coming to Christ’s mangers, including Indian farm laborers and
                  African slaves.  The composer uses rhythm to differentiate the
                  speech and movement of each group, and at the climax he even has
                  the Angolans and the angels sing together—but in different meters.</p>
                  <p class="abstract">
                  Based on the first edition of this music, the article interprets
                  this villancico within the social and theological context of
                  colonial Puebla and its new cathedral, consecrated in 1649. I
                  argue that through this music, members of the Spanish elite
                  performed their own vision of a hierarchical and harmonious
                  society.  Gutiérrez de Padilla was himself both a priest and a
                  slaveholder, and his music elevates its characters in certain ways
                  while paradoxically also mocking them and reinforcing their lowly
                  status. Building on Paul Ricoeur’s concept of the <q>three worlds of
                    the text,</q> the article compares the representations imagined
                  within the musical performance with archival evidence for the
                  social history of the people represented and the composer’s own
                  relationships with them (the world behind the text).  Looking to
                  the world projected <q>in front of</q> the text, I argue that these
                  caricatured representations both reflected and shaped Spaniards’
                  attitudes toward their subjects in ways that actively affected the
                  people represented. At the same time, I argue that Spanish
                  representations mirrored practices of impersonation among Native
                  American and African communities, especially the Christmastide
                  Black Kings festivals, pointing to a more complex and
                  contradictory vision of colonial society than what we can see from
                  the slaveholder’s musical fantasy alone.

                  <p class="abstract">
                  As part of the festivities of Corpus Christi in 1628, a cathedral
                  choir in colonial Mexico sang about the Eucharist through the metaphor
                  of a card game.  This music is a previously unstudied, fragmentary
                  villancico, composed by Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla for the cathedral of
                  Puebla de los Ángeles, and it opens a window into the social history
                  of card-playing and gambling in the Spanish colonies.  It stems from a
                  broader tradition of <q>divinizing</q> cards, including poetry and
                  drama by Lope de Vega and González de Eslava.  The article explores
                  the theological and social implications of using liturgical music to
                  present Christ as a rogue card player, winning humanity back from the
                  devil by laying down the trump card of his own body on the table.
                  Includes an edition of the surviving music.  The online version
                  includes a recording played on the organ by the author.

                  <p class="abstract">
                  In seventeenth-century Mexico and Spain, many villancicos (the
                  predominant genre of vocal sacred music with vernacular words) used
                  music to represent itself, with topics of singing, dancing, and music
                  of the spheres.  This study draws on such pieces as sources for
                  understanding early modern Catholic beliefs about music.  The central
                  question concerns music’s role in the relationship between hearing and
                  faith, particularly as used by the Spanish church and state.  In a
                  series of case studies, the project traces lineages of “metamusical”
                  villancicos on the subject of heavenly music through networks of
                  interrelated musicians.  The study balances a global perspective with
                  local case studies, with particular focus on Puebla de los Ángeles in
                  Mexico and Montserrat, Segovia, and Zaragoza in Spain.

                  Despite the prominence of the hymns of Paul Gerhardt (1607–1676)
                  in the liturgical works of J. S. Bach and in churches today, scholars
                  like Irmgard Scheitler and Walter Blankenburg have argued that
                  Lutherans in the seventeenth century used new hymns like Gerhardt’s
                  only for private devotion, and did not sing them in public liturgies
                  until the eighteenth century, under the influence of Pietism.  In
                  contrast, Christian Bunners argues that church choirs introduced the
                  liturgical use of these hymns before Pietism.  This thesis explores
                  the role of Gerhardt’s hymns in Lutheran communities in the three
                  spheres of home, school, and church.  It critically examines numerous
                  hymnal publications, and presents new evidence from school and church
                  manuscript collections and inventories, not considered by the other
                  scholars, arguing that Gerhardt’s hymns were not relegated to domestic
                  use, but were also sung in church in many places by school choirs and
                  perhaps also congregations.
