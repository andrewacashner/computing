        <h1>Profile</h1>

        <p>
        I am a musician and scholar of music, specializing in religious music
        and devotional practices with particular focus on early modern
        Christianity in the Spanish-speaking world and colonial cultures.
        I am an assistant professor of music at the University of Rochester. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I teach courses in the history, structure, and cultural meanings of
        music.
        See the <a href="teaching/index.html">teaching</a> page for course
        descriptions.
        </p>
        <p>
        My research examines how people have used music to express and enact
        their religious beliefs.  
        I am interested in how people across time and in different cultures use
        music to create relationships with each other and with what Olivier
        Messiaen called <q>the world beyond</q>, especially the ways that music
        can delineate and transgress boundaries between sacred and secular
        domains, and between elite and common social strata.
        My areas of interest include the history and theology of Christian
        worship, colonial studies and global music history, ritual studies and
        hermeneutic theory, musical analysis and interpretation, and music
        transcription, editing, and digital encoding.
        I am pursuing a holistic approach to understanding how structures of
        musical sound are linked to structures of society and belief.

        My research has been recognized by the 2015 Alfred Einstein Award from
        the American Musicological Society, and by fellowships and grants from
        the American Council of Learned Societies, the Center for European
        Studies at Columbia University, the Center for Latin American Studies
        at the University of Chicago, and the US Department of Education.

        My first book, <cite>Hearing Faith: Music as Theology in the Spanish
          Empire</cite> (Leiden: Brill, 2020) is a study of <q>music about
          music</q> in villancicos, a genre of vernacular devotional music
        from seventeenth-century Mexico and Spain.
        These <q>metamusical</q> villancicos&mdash;such as pieces about heavenly
        and angelic music, the harmony of the spheres, and representations of
        human singing and dancing&mdash;reveal how Hispanic Catholics understood
        music’s power in the relationship between hearing and faith.
        The music studied in the book is available in two volumes of scores I
        edited.
        Related articles explore villancicos in particular local contexts,
        particularly with regard to the colonial setting in America.
        </p>
        <p>
        My current research and writing are focused on the role of singing and
        listening in the encounters between Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) peoples
        and Europeans in colonial-era New York; and on the history of music in
        Christian worship.

        <a href="villancicos/index.html">villancico</a> pages or contact me
        for more information on my research.

        I perform regularly on piano, organ, and harpsichord.
        I enjoy collaboration and improvisation across a broad stylistic range.
        My compositions include choral music, solo songs, congregational
        worship songs, and solo piano pieces.
        I lead the worship ministry at New Hope Free Methodist Church in
        Rochester.
        See the <a href="performance/index.html">performance</a> page for
        recordings and scores.  
        </p>
        <p>
        I received the PhD in the history and theory of music from the
        University of Chicago in 2015.  
        I received the Master of Sacred Music degree in organ performance from
        the University of Notre Dame, and a Bachelor of Music in piano
        performance from Lawrence University.
        I also studied piano performance at the New England Conservatory of
        Music.
