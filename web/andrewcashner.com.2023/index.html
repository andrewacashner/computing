        I am a <strong>professional musician</strong> based in Rochester, New York.
        I am active as a performer and improviser on piano and organ in a variety of styles, and I have composed and arranged for piano, chorus, and strings.
        I teach keyboard in the <a href="https://rocmusic.org">ROC Music</a> after-school program and I have taught at the University of Rochester and the University of Southern California.
        I earned the PhD in music from the University of Chicago and studied organ and piano performance at the University of Notre Dame, Lawrence University, and the New England Conservatory of Music.

        I am a <strong>writer and researcher</strong> with publications on
        Native American song, music in colonial Mexico, music in the history of science, and software for digital-humanities research.
        With Seneca faithkeeper and singer Bill Crouse, Sr., I am coauthoring the website <a href="https://senecasongs.earth"><cite>Songs at the Woods’ Edge: The Earth Songs of the Seneca Nation</cite></a> 
        with the support of a Fellowship for Digital Publication from the National Endowment for the Humanities. 
        My book <a href="https://doi.org/10.1163/9789004431997"><cite>Hearing Faith: Music as Theology in the Spanish Empire</cite> (Brill, 2020)</a> is one of several peer-reviewed studies of religious music and popular devotion in Mexico and Spain, focusing on the <a href="villancicos/index.html">villancico</a> genre, including two volumes of critical music editions.
        For my first article I was awarded the 2015 Alfred Einstein Award of the American Musicological Society, and my research has also been supported by fellowships from the American Council of Learned Societies, the Mellon Foundation, and the US Department of Education.

        I am a <strong>software developer</strong> with experience in front-end web development in Javascript and Typescript with the React.js framework, and in back-end development in Python with the Django framework and with PHP.
        I enjoy functional programming in Scheme and Haskell and object-oriented programming in C♯, with low-level experience in C.
        Recent projects include the <a href="https://arca1650.info">Arca musarithmica</a>, an implementation in Haskell of a computing device for automatic music composition invented by Athanasius Kircher in 1650, and <a href="https://chronoquiz.net">Chronoquiz</a>, which enables users to build and share their own historical timeline quiz games.
        I have contributed open-source software to the LaTeX and Lilypond user communities for digital typography, including the <a href="http://ctan.org/author/cashner">musicography</a> package for technical writing about music.
