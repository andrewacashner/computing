                  <p class="abstract">
                  This course provides music majors the opportunity to build
                  a conceptual framework for understanding how and why
                  people in Europe and European colonies made music between
                  about 1600 and 1800 and what it meant to them.  It equips
                  students to think historically about music (understanding
                  change over time in forms, practices, and concepts of
                  music), and to think musically about history
                  (understanding lived experience in the past through
                  music).  The course highlights the interconnection between
                  the sound of music and the social structures that music
                  shapes and is shaped by. The class emphasizes, on the one
                  hand, how European people used music to build a <q>Western</q>
                  world, which included developing a canon of musical
                  <q>classics</q>; and on the other hand, their exchanges with
                  and impacts on indigenous peoples in different global
                  locations. The course highlights the musical creativity of
                  women, people of color, and lower-class people.
                  Students will gain detailed knowledge of musical repertoire
                  from this period through close engagement with the sources,
                  including transcription and performance; while developing
                  critical thinking skills through research, writing, and oral
                  presentation.

                  <p class="abstract">
                  Arranging is a key skill in any practicing musician's toolbox.
                  Whether you are reworking an existing song for an a capella or
                  theater group, producing a recording of an original song, or
                  adapting music to fit the practical needs of an amateur
                  ensemble, this class can help you craft effective and
                  appealing arrangements. Students will develop and workshop
                  their own projects with the class while we learn from examples
                  by today's pop and Broadway arrangers, as well as past masters
                  of arrangement including Bach, Mozart, and Liszt. With an
                  emphasis on simple solutions that work for performers of
                  varying skill levels, the course will show you how to bring
                  out the best in the source music while presenting the
                  performing ensemble in its best light.  Prequisite: Basic
                  ability to read music and to sing or play an instrument.

                  <summary>Experiencing Music (MUSC 100)</summary>
                  <p class="abstract">
                  This course introduces you to music as a discipline for
                  understanding human experience.  It considers both how
                  people <em>do</em> music and how we talk and think about
                  music (in other words the course is introductory both to
                  music and to musicology).
                  Its goal is to equip you to think critically about the
                  experience of music and to empower you to engage with
                  music in a way that will not only enrich your life in a
                  lasting way but also allow you to make a positive impact
                  in society.  We will break down the complex whole of
                  musical experience into different elements of how the
                  music sounds and how the music functions socially, so that
                  you can understand how those elements interact to make
                  music mean something to people.
                  The course strongly emphasizes music by Black and
                  indigenous music creators.

                  <p class="abstract">
                  Since ancient times people have used music to tell stories on
                  stage, from Oedipus and Orpheus to Tosca and Hamilton.  This
                  course gives students the opportunity to engage closely with
                  works of musical drama on related themes from multiple global
                  traditions, including American musical theater, Italian opera,
                  and Beijing opera.  We will explore how composers, performers,
                  and producers combine drama, music, staging, spectacle, and
                  dance to create multisensory dramatic experiences for
                  audiences.  The creative contributions of women and people of
                  color will be highlighted as we consider these controversial
                  traditions, which have so often entertained the wealthy while
                  reinforcing inequity but have also enabled people to question
                  power by envisioning a new society on stage.  Emphasis on
                  discussion and group work; no prior musical knowledge or
                  ability is required.

                  <p class="abstract">
                  This course explores the changing functions and meanings
                  of music in Christian worship practices, from the
                  first-century house churches to contemporary megachurches.
                  We will see how Christians developed music and ritual to
                  embody their beliefs and structure their communities.  We
                  will listen closely to music ranging from Gregorian chant
                  and liturgical music of Palestrina, Bach, and Mozart to
                  Protestant hymns and psalms and contemporary evangelical
                  worship music.  The course will equip students to
                  understand how people have used music to create
                  relationships with God and with each other.
                  </p>
                  <p class="abstract">
                  Rather than presenting worship as a single, unchanging
                  tradition or elevating one type of liturgy above all
                  others, this course focuses on different Christian
                  communities’ creative responses to times of crisis,
                  including the COVID-19 pandemic.  The course will
                  emphasize Christianity’s global dimensions, with special
                  emphasis on the problems of intercultural missions and
                  colonization and the contributions of women and people of
                  color.  The instructor is both a musicologist specializing
                  in Christian worship and a practicing worship leader.  No
                  musical training or knowledge is required, nor is
                  religious background or belief.

                    Discoveries, 1492 to 1800 (MUSC 205)</summary>
                  <p class="abstract">
                  After 1492, Europeans and other peoples around the globe
                  began to discover each other in new ways, and music played a
                  vital role in their encounters. 
                  This course equips students to develop a global perspective
                  on music in the early modern era.
                  Through case studies in Latin America, New England, China,
                  and Africa, students will gain insight into the ways people
                  use music as an agent of political and religious power in
                  processes of cultural exchange and conflict. 
                  The course examines how missionaries and colonial leaders
                  mixed musical cultures to build new social structures; and
                  how colonial subjects responded creatively, in collaboration
                  or resistance, to shape hybrid identities. 
                  We will study musical practices from both sides of the
                  encounters, including Chinese and Native American musics and
                  exported European practices like religious choral music and
                  popular dances.  
                  No prior musical knowledge is required.

                  <p class="abstract">
                  This course equips students to understand the key role of
                  music in shaping the new identities and beliefs of the
                  Christian communities that emerged from the Reformations of
                  the sixteenth century: Lutherans, Calvinists, Anglicans, and
                  Roman Catholics, including colonial societies around the
                  globe.
                  We will study the link between faith, music, and community
                  in Lutheran chorales and Puritan psalms, Palestrina's masses
                  and J. S. Bach's Passions, and music from colonial Latin
                  America. 
                  In light of theological literature of the time we will study
                  how music served as a form of ritual and prayer for
                  communities and individuals. 
                  This historical knowledge will enable students to understand
                  the roots of living traditions of Christian worship today. 
                  No musical or theological background required.
