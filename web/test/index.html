<h1> Profile </h1>

<p>
I am a musician and scholar of music, specializing in devotional music of early modern Mexico and Spain.
I am an assistant professor of musicology at the <a href="http://music.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>.
In the USC Thornton School of Music, I teach courses in the history, structure, and cultural meanings of music, as of fall 2015.
See the <a href="teaching/index.html">teaching</a> page for current courses.

<p>
My research examines how people have used music to express and enact their religious beliefs.
I am interested in how people across time and in different cultures use music to create relationships with each other and with what Olivier Messiaen called <q>the world beyond</q>, especially the ways that music can delineate and transgress boundaries between sacred and secular domains, and between elite and common social strata.
</p>

<p>
My current book project is a study of <q>music about music</q> in villancicos, a genre of vernacular devotional music from seventeenth-century Mexico and Spain.
These <q>metamusical</q> villancicos&mdash;such as pieces about heavenly and angelic music, the harmony of the spheres, and representations of human singing and dancing&mdash;reveal how Hispanic Catholics understood music's power in the relationship between hearing and faith.
See the <a href="research/index.html">research</a> page for more information.
</p>


<p>
I perform regularly on piano, organ, and harpsichord.
I enjoy collaboration and improvisation across a broad stylistic range.
My compositions include choral music, songs, and solo piano pieces.
See the <a href="performance/index.html">performance</a> page for recordings and scores.
</p>

<p>
I received the PhD from the University of Chicago in 2015, with the dissertation <q>Faith, Hearing, and the Power of Music in Hispanic Villancicos, 1660&ndash;1700</q>.
I received the Master of Sacred Music degree from the University of Notre Dame in 2009, and a Bachelor of Music from Lawrence University in 2003.
I also studied at the New England Conservatory of Music.
See the <a href="cv.html">curriculum vitae</a> page for more information on my publications and experience.
