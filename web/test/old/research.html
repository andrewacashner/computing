<h3>
<q>Playing Cards at the Eucharistic Table: Music, Theology, and Society in a Corpus Christi Villancico from Colonial Mexico, 1628</q>
</h3>
<p>
<cite><a href="http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/15700658/18/4">Journal of Early Modern History</a></cite>, vol. 18, no. 4 (2014), 383—419. </p>

<blockquote>
As part of the festivities of Corpus Christi in 1628, a cathedral choir in colonial Mexico sang about the Eucharist through the metaphor of a card game. 
This music is a previously unstudied, fragmentary villancico, composed by Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla for the cathedral of Puebla de los Ángeles, and it opens a window into the social history of card-playing and gambling in the Spanish colonies. 
It stems from a broader tradition of <q>divinizing</q> cards, including poetry and drama by Lope de Vega and González de Eslava. 
The article explores the theological and social implications of using liturgical music to present Christ as a rogue card player, winning humanity back from the devil by laying down the trump card of his own body on the table. 
Includes an edition of the surviving music. 
The online version includes a recording played on the organ by the author.

<q>Faith, Hearing, and the Power of Music in Hispanic Villancicos, 1600–1700</q>

</p>

<blockquote>
In seventeenth-century Mexico and Spain, many villancicos (the predominant genre of vocal sacred music with vernacular words) used music to represent itself, with topics of singing, dancing, and music of the spheres. 
This study draws on such pieces as sources for understanding early modern Catholic beliefs about music. 
The central question concerns music's role in the relationship between hearing and faith, particularly as used by the Spanish church and state. 
The project traces lineages of <q>metamusical</q> villancicos through networks of interrelated musicians, balancing a global perspective with a case study of the Cathedral of Puebla de los Ángeles in modern Mexico.

<h3>
<q>The Reception of Paul Gerhardt's Hymns in the Seventeenth Century</q>
</h3>

<p>
Master of Sacred Music thesis, University of Notre Dame, 2009<br />
Advisor: Prof. Mary E. Frandsen
</p>

<blockquote>
Despite the prominence of the hymns of Paul Gerhardt (1607–1676) in the liturgical works of J. S. Bach and in churches today, scholars like Irmgard Scheitler and Walter Blankenburg have argued that Lutherans in the seventeenth century used new hymns like Gerhardt’s only for private devotion, and did not sing them in public liturgies until the eighteenth century, under the influence of Pietism. 
In contrast, Christian Bunners argues that church choirs introduced the liturgical use of these hymns before Pietism. 
This thesis explores the role of Gerhardt’s hymns in Lutheran communities in the three spheres of home, school, and church. 
It critically examines numerous hymnal publications, and presents new evidence from school and church manuscript collections and inventories, not considered by the other scholars, arguing that Gerhardt’s hymns were not relegated to domestic use, but were also sung in church in many places by school choirs and perhaps also congregations.
