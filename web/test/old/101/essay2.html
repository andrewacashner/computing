<h1 id="topic">Topic</h1>
<p>This essay, like our course, is about what it might mean for music to be art. In the last three weeks, we have heard and discussed different ways that Western people expressed religious faith through music in medieval and early modern periods. <em>How did pre-modern Christian conceptions of the world shape the notion of musical art?</em> What was the purpose or function of music for the writers and musicians we have studied in these three weeks? <em>In particular, to what extent did music serve as “art for art’s sake,” as opposed to being a means to religious devotion?</em> Or is that a false dichotomy? Might music’s function as devotion have been closely connected to an understanding of music as an art form?</p>
<p>These are big questions. My own dissertation, currently some four hundred pages, concerns one aspect of this question as demonstrated in one repertoire of music in one century and one cultural group. I understand that much of this will be overly generalized, since we are talking about a timespan of about seven hundred years across several different regions and multiple religious traditions. So I do not expect you to provide a definitive answer in a short essay and with limited research sources. I also would not ask you to do any kind of personal theological speculation or confession of your own.</p>
<p>Rather, based only the texts available to you from the syllabus and the class lectures and discussions, draw some connections between these sources (primary and secondary) that might shed some light on this question. <em>What is the conception of musical art in Boethius, in Hildegard, in Monteverdi, in Bach?</em> You need not try to cover every source. Instead, <em>select two or three examples that demonstrate the development of a particular idea (which might mean continuity or contrast).</em> You should also <em>discuss at least one piece of music</em>, attempting (though this can be quite challenging) to connect the beliefs about music to how the music sounds. I am looking for intelligent, considered reflection on these sources at a <em>detailed</em> level, in a way that shows engagement with the central themes of our course.</p>
<h1 id="submission-instructions">Submission instructions</h1>
<p>Write an essay of about 1000–1200 words.</p>
<p>Save your file as a plain text file with a .txt extension and UTF-8 Unicode encoding.</p>
<p>Use the file name lastname-essay2.txt (e.g., cashner-essay2.txt).</p>
<p>If you don’t know what UTF-8 encoding is, see the section below on creating a text file. Note that using “Save as text file” from Microsoft Word does not work properly.</p>
<p>Please make use of office hours (Thu. 3–4 p.m. at Ex Libris, or by appointment), and please do not hesitate to ask about any questions, conceptual or mechanical.</p>
<h2 id="formatting">Formatting</h2>
<p>Use a new line for each sentence. Leave a blank line between each paragraph.</p>
<p>Keep the text as simple as you can. Use plain (not “smart”) quotation marks. If italic text is necessary, mark the word to be italicized with asterisks like *this*. Use two hyphens when you want a long dash. Accented characters, umlauts, and so on are all fine, since they are included in the UTF-8 encoding.</p>
<p>(You may use <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a> syntax if you know it.)</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-text-file">Creating a text file</h2>
<p>If you already are comfortable using a text editor like <code>Vim</code> or <code>Emacs</code> to create UTF-8 .txt files, then keep doing what you are doing.</p>
<p> If not, then any of the editors listed below will work well to get started.
Using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a> both saves you money and gives you the freedom to do what you like with the software (no license fees or legal restrictions). 
<code>Notepad++</code> is a good choice for Windows, and <code>gedit</code> is good for both Linux and Mac OSX (for Mac, use version 2.30, not version 3.0).

	<li><a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> (Windows)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jedit</a> (all platforms, requires Java)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The next two editors do not require payment but are not really free software (in Spanish, they are “gratis” but not “libre”).
Nevertheless, both are popular and useful.
