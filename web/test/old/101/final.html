<h1>Music 101 Final Project</h1>

<p>
University of Chicago, Spring 2013 (Cashner)
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

In collaboration with other students, research and present a profile on a composer active in the last fifty years.
The groups and composers will be assigned below.
Each group will prepare the following items.
Details for each item are listed below.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>A simple web page, with a link to a YouTube playlist</li>
	<li>An annotated bibliography, included as part of the web page</li>
	<li>A ten-minute class presentation</li>
	<li>A brief report on what each member of the group contributed to the project (include this at the bottom of the web page)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Due Dates</h2>

<p>
For use in the class presentations, the HTML file for each group’s web page is due on Saturday, May 31, at 11:59 p.m.
This first version does not need to include the annotated bibliography.
</p>

<p>
Class presentations will be on Monday, June 2, and Wednesday, June 4, 2014.

<p>
The final web page, including the bibliography and description of the group members' work, is due on Wednesday, June 11, at 10:30 a.m. or before.

<h2>The Annotated Bibliography</h2>

<p>
An annotated bibliography is a list of sources with a paragraph describing each source.
The description should include a basic overview of what the source contains and what it contributes to understanding your composer.
The bibliography must include the following items at a minimum.
No item may count in two categories.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>One encyclopedia article</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Start with <em>Grove Music Online.</em></li>
			<li>Wikipedia doesn’t count here.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Two printed books</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Literature about music is in the library (third floor) under ML.</li>
			<li>There may not be a book specifically about your composer, but their works might be discussed in a book on another topic.</li>
			<li>Doctoral dissertations may be used here, though published books are preferred.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Three articles in academic journals</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>One must date from after 2001.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>One websites or online resource</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Three printed musical scores</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>In the library under M.</li>
			<li>These should be different genres and instrumentations (so, not all piano pieces, for example).
				They should reflect the composer’s career and reputation: if the composer was know for his operas, you should include an opera.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Five recordings</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>In the library recordings collection (third floor): ask at the desk.</li>
			<li>Two of these must be vinyl LP records.</li>
			<li>Two others must be compact discs.</li>
			<li>One can be an online source that can’t be found in another medium, such as a live concert recording (Naxos online doesn’t count here).
				</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>

<h2>The Web Page</h2>

<p>
The web page should follow <a href="schnittke.html">this model</a>, but with more complete information and more thoughtful analysis.
See the HTML Basics tutorial to learn the basic HTML required for this assignment.
</p>

<p>
The web page should include a <strong>profile</strong> describing the composer’s place in history and the defining characteristics of the composer’s music.
It should also include a concise <strong>biography</strong> in outline form, and your <strong>annotated bibliography</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The web page should include a link to a <strong>YouTube playlist</strong> with <strong>at least five videos</strong> of music by the composer.
One of the members of your group will need a free Gmail account in order to log in to YouTube and create the playlist.
You could also create a group Gmail account just for the purposes of this assignment.
</p>

<h2>The Class Presentation</h2>

<p>
In the class presentation, the group members will share their web page with the class and provide a basic introduction to the composer. 
You will not discuss your whole bibliography, though you might mention a few interesting sources.
Your presentation, like the profile on the web page, should sketch an answer to these questions:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>What did this composer see as the function of music?</li>
	<li>What kinds of musical structures did the composer use?</li>
	<li>What kind of meaning have people seen in the composer’s music?</li>
	<li>How is the composer connected to other composers in links of influence?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Leave time to play an excerpt from one recording or video. 
LP records are encouraged.
</p>

<h2>Finding and Using Sources</h2>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://lib.uchicago.edu">U of C library catalog</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://guides.lib.uchicago.edu/music">Library’s music resources page</a></li>
	<li>Resources available by searching the library catalog:
		<ul>
			<li>RILM, the index to literature about music, including articles, books, and dissertations</li>
			<li>IIMP, the index to music periodicals (journals)</li>
			<li>JSTOR, an index to journals in all subjects, with many articles available online</li>
			<li>ProQuest Dissertations</li>
			<li>WorldCat, a catalog of every book in every major library of the world: if you can’t find it in the Regenstein, look here and request it through Interlibrary Loan</li>
			<li><em>Oxford Music Online</em>, including <em>Grove Music Online</em></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Google (Google Books, Scholar, etc.)</li>
	<li>Wikipedia (can be useful as a starting point)</li>
</ul>

<p>
For preparing your citations, please see the <em>Chicago Manual of Style, 16th ed.</em> (search the library catalog for the online version). 
Use the “bibliography” style for your citations.
The book includes a “Quick Citation Guide” that summarizes the basic guidelines.
</p>

<p>
For questions about using these resources, ask your professor and ask the Regenstein Library’s Bibliographer for Music, Scott Landvatter (slandvat at uchicago.edu, Regenstein rm. 362).
