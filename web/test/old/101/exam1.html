<h1 id="topic">Topic</h1>
<p>The theme for this essay is interpretation. The goal is to apply what you have learned about the elements of music, and what we have practiced in class, to reflect on the song “Youth and Love” from <em>Songs of Travel</em>.</p>
<p>Vaughan Williams’s setting interprets Stevenson’s poem; different performers distinctly interpret Vaughan Williams’s setting (and in turn the poem). Your task for this assignment, as a listener, is to consider these acts of interpretation and venture your own. How do you, in listening, interpret these interpretations? And how can you convey that interpretive process in writing?</p>
<p>The central question is this: <em>How does the musical version, as written by the composer and performed by the musicians, shape your experience of the poem and its meaning?</em></p>
<h1 id="process">Process</h1>
<p>In addition to the recorded performance by Bryn Terfel that you purchased, choose two additional recordings of the song “Youth and Love” from <em>Songs of Travel</em> by Ralph Vaughan Williams from the Naxos Music Library online (there are at least seven versions there).</p>
<p>First consider Stevenson’s poem on its own terms—its structure and thematic content.</p>
<p>Next map out Vaughan Williams’s musical setting using track timings from the Terfel recording. Try to account for what happens in this song on the “sheerly musical” plane, using whatever terms work for you—not necessarily official technical ones. Consider each of the elements of music we have discussed so far (rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, and timbre), and also think about what structural sections there might be. (If you read music, you may also use bar numbers from the score, but this is <em>not</em> necessary. <em>Listening</em> is the most important task here.)</p>
<p>Next consider how the poetry and music fit together. What does the music <em>do</em> for the poem? How does the sung version interpret, project, dramatize, or illustrate the poem? Does it increase the possible meanings of the text or make the meaning more specific?</p>
<p>Finally, compare Terfel’s performance with the other two you have chosen: what is similar and what is different in the singers’ and pianists’ interpretations? Again, consider the elements of music. Though all the recordings purport to present the same piece of music, in each of the elements (especially rhythm and timbre) they vary widely. Pay special attention to the shadings of the singer’s vocal color and diction. Use these comparisons to shape your idea of how the song functions to interpret the text, and how the performers interpret the song.</p>
<p>Note that this section describes the work you should do in advance of writing your essay: <em>it is not a schematic outline of the essay</em>.</p>
<h1 id="product">Product</h1>
<p>Write an essay of about 900 words that addresses the central question, drawing on specific evidence from the musical recordings to support your arguments.</p>
<p>You should focus on specific moments or small sections in the piece that illuminate either the composer’s interpretation, or that of the singers and pianists. Though you do not need to have the kind of thesis you would defend in a persuasive paper, try to identify a specific idea that you can concentrate on, rather than a series of general observations. This will not be a technical musical analysis in the terms of music theory.</p>
<p>Save the paper as a plain text (.txt) file, as per the instructions for the <a href="concert.html">concert review</a> paper. Leave a blank space between paragraphs, and use quotation marks for all titles (since italics are not an option).</p>
<p>Use in-text parenthetical citations. Cite the recordings basically like you would a book, with the performers as the “author.” The first time, give a full citation in the note; subsequent times, just refer to the performers’ names and give the track timings in parentheses, like so:</p>
<ul>
<li>A recording by Bryn Terfel with pianist Malcolm Martineau (“The Vagabond and Other Songs by Vaughan Williams, Butterworth, Finzi, Ireland,” Hamburg: Deutsche Grammophon, 1995, tr. 4) [. . .]</li>
<li>[. . .] unlike in Byrn Terfel’s version (3:00–3:14).</li>
