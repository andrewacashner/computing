<h1 id="concert-review-assignment">Concert Review Assignment</h1>
<p>Music 101 (2014), Cashner</p>
<p><strong>Attend a concert of your choice</strong>, approved in advance by the professor.</p>
<p>The music should be in the tradition of “Western art music”—say, something like a symphony orchestra, chamber music ensemble, chorus, newly composed music (like the “Contempo” series at the U of C), and not a rock or jazz band or live DJ. (By all means do go to those things, just not for this assignment. All music has value!) When in doubt, just ask. Ideally you would attend something that is less familiar to you, something outside your comfort zone. The Contempo concerts are both free and guaranteed to be new to you (since they are usually first performances of new pieces).</p>
<p>In response, <strong>write a review essay of about 500 words</strong>. This is not a newspaper-type review, where a critic appraises what was good and bad, or interesting or new about a performance (e.g., “He seemed uncomfortable in the virtuoso passages of the Liszt piece, but his innate musical intelligence began to shine in the intricate passagework of the Bach partita.” Don’t write this sort of thing.)</p>
<p>Instead, think a bit like an anthropologist, or, in the spirit of the Voyager Golden Disc, like a visitor from outer space. Your primary goal here is to <strong>record your observations of the event, and reflect critically on the musical experience.</strong> These might include the following, but you are not limited to this list.</p>
<ul>
<li>What music was performed? (Be specific)</li>
<li>Who were the musicians? What did they wear, and how did they behave?</li>
<li>Where was the concert? What was the space like? How were the musicians and listeners arranged?</li>
<li>How did the audience behave?</li>
<li>What expectations did you have in advance of what the music would sound like? Where did these expectations come from? (From prior experience, from poster art, program notes?)</li>
<li>Did the music sound the way you thought it would? What surprised you?</li>
<li>What would you have changed about the performance and why?</li>
<li>MOST IMPORTANTLY: <em>What did it seem like the purpose (goal, function, mission) of the musical performance was? Do you think it accomplished that goal in your case, or for the audience members around you?</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="submitting-the-assignment">Submitting the assignment</h2>
<p>Write the essay in clear, direct, and careful academic style, and proofread it carefully before submission.</p>
<p><strong>Save the file as a plain text file (.txt)</strong>, with the filename like so: lastname-concert.txt (example: cashner-concert.txt).</p>
<p><strong>Attach the file on this assignment page in Chalk.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Also attach a scanned or photographed image of a few pages of the program in PDF format.</strong></p>
<p>To create a text file:</p>
<p>On Mac: Use the program TextEdit, included with the operating system (search for it in Spotlight or look in Applications). Go to the Preferences menu, select the “New Document” tab, and under “Format,” select “Plain Text” (not RTF).</p>
<p>On Windows: Use the program Notepad.</p>
<p>On Linux/BSD: Use gEdit, Mousepad, or other text editor that came with your distribution. If you use the command line, use Vim, Emacs, Nano, Pico, etc. (also true for the Mac OSX command line).</p>
<p>If you like, you could write the assignment in your favorite word processor (LibreOffice, Google Docs, Word, Pages) and then just paste the text into one of the text editors above.</p>
<p>If the above makes no sense, please ask for help.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-assignment-will-be-graded">How the assignment will be graded</h2>
<p><strong>The concert essay is due at the beginning of the last class session, 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, June 4, but you are encouraged to turn it in any time before that.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The grade for late assignments will be reduced by one full letter grade for each day they are late.</strong></p>
<p>A C assignment will convey the basic information about what the concert was, but will not contain much critical reflection.<br />It may be poorly organized or contain grammatical or spelling errors. It may be difficult to read and understand, either because the thoughts are not coherent or because they are presented in vague or needlessly complicated language. The writer may dwell too much on personal opinion, without supporting the opinions with the evidence of observations from the event. (Note again that the assignment does not ask you to say whether you liked the music or the rendition.)</p>
<p>A B assignment will address not only the basics of the event, but also present some clear and insightful thinking about how the performance functioned. It may contain a few errors or writing problems, but the basic ideas come across clearly. The ideas are well supported by reference to observed evidence.</p>
<p>An A assignment will do everything the B assignment does, but in an especially insightful and thought-provoking way. There are no mechanical errors, and the writing is not only clear, but is engaging and creative.</p>
<p>Assignments worthy of failing grades (D and F) do not address the questions asked in the prompt, contain serious mechanical defects, may be difficult or impossible to understand. They do not reflect a serious attempt to engage with the assignment. They may contain material irrelevant to the assignment, such as extensive discussion of Wikipedia-like historical background, instead of focusing on the specific performance attended.</p>
<p>Do not paraphrase liner notes, reviews, or Internet material on the music from the concert!</p>
<p><strong>Assignments containing plagiarized content will receive a grade of zero.</strong></p>
