# TO DO

- allow user to supply timeline data (JSON or YAML, or custom interface)
- animation/color when user gets answer right or wrong

- mobile CSS: 
    - can't center items without having both ends cut off

- in finding first card to the right:
    - Need to look at outside edges of cards, not just drop point

- animation, sound when getting it right
- no penalty when getting it wrong; + error sound

- color of clue card?
