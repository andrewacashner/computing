# TO DO

## Core functions
- in finding first card to the right:
    - Need to look at outside edges of cards, not just drop point

## Expansions
- add more fields to cards (image, sound/video)
- allow user to supply timeline data (JSON or YAML, or custom interface)

## User interface
- animation/color when user gets answer right or wrong
- no penalty when getting it wrong; + error sound
- negative points or not? (currently wrong = negative down to zero)

## Layout
- mobile CSS: 
    - can't center items without having both ends cut off
- color of clue card?
- fonts
