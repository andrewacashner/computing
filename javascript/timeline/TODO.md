# TO DO

## Expansions
- add more fields to cards (image, sound/video)
- allow user to supply timeline data (JSON or YAML, or custom interface)

## User interface
- animation/color when user gets answer right or wrong
- no penalty when getting it wrong; + error sound
- negative points or not? (currently wrong = negative down to zero)

## Layout
- mobile CSS: 
    - can't center items without having both ends cut off
- fonts
