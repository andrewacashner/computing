# TO DO

## Expansions
- add audio/video to cards?
    - how could users add media by path??
- separate modules

## User interface
- error sound

## Layout
- mobile CSS: 
    - can't center items without having both ends cut off
- image layout different on timeline vs. clues (min-width problem?)
- timeline rule should always extend to full width as it expands

## Drag/drop
- Consistency and predictability of drag target
- Dragover/dragleave on guess card vs. dropping to left of guess card
- You can know what color the card will be in advance by sorting the clue
  list, don't need to reset colors every time
