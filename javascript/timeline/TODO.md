# TO DO

## Expansions
- add audio/video to cards?
    - how could users add media by path??

## User interface
- error sound

## Layout
- mobile CSS: 
    - can't center items without having both ends cut off
- drop target doesn't always work (related to width problem)
- image layout different on timeline vs. clues (min-width problem?)
