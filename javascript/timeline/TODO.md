# TO DO

## Expansions
- add audio/video to cards?
    - how could users add media by path??
- separate modules

## User interface
- error sound

## Layout
- mobile CSS: 
    - can't center items without having both ends cut off
- image layout different on timeline vs. clues (min-width problem?)
- timeline rule should always extend to full width as it expands

- Now we adjust width when updating timeline to fix above problems, but the
  mobile layout is awkward and maybe unplayable? Need to be able to scroll the
  timeline while it is centered below the card.

## Drag/drop
- Shift left also?
