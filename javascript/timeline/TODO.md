# TO DO

- deal with dates BC
    - use Javascript Date type?
- reload without reposting?
    - get data from php a better way?
        - read json in php, not javascript?

## Expansions
- add more fields to cards (image, sound/video)
- allow user to supply timeline data (JSON or YAML, or custom interface)

## User interface
- no penalty when getting it wrong; + error sound

## Layout
- mobile CSS: 
    - can't center items without having both ends cut off
