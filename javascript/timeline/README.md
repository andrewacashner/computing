# Description

In this game, players build a chronological timeline of historical events.
Given a clue with no date, the user drags the clue onto the timeline where
they think it belongs.
If they are correct, the clue is inserted in the timeline and they get a
point.
If they are incorrect, the clue is not inserted so they can guess again,
but they lose a point.
When all clues are done, the final score is shown.
