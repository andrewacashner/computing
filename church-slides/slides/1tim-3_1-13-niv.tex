\begin{frame}{1 Timothy 3:1--13 (NIV)}
Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble
task.
Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate,
self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to
drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. 
He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he
must do so in a manner worthy of full respect. 
(If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of
God's church?) 
He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the
same judgment as the devil. 
He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall
into disgrace and into the devil's trap.

In the same way, deacons are to be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in
much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. 
They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience. 
They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them
serve as deacons.

In the same way, the women are to be worthy of respect, not malicious talkers
but temperate and trustworthy in everything.
A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his
household well.
Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in
their faith in Christ Jesus.
