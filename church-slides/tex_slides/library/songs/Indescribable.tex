\begin{song}{Indescribable}

    \begin{songframe}{v1a}
        From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea \\
        Creation's revealing Your majesty \\
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{v1b}
        From the colors of Fall to the fragrance of Spring \\
        Every creature unique in the song that it sings \\
        All exclaiming
    \end{songframe}


    \begin{songframe}{ch1a}
        Indescribable uncontainable \\
        You placed the stars in the sky \\
        And You know them by name \\
        You are amazing, God
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{ch1b}
        All powerful untamable \\
        Awestruck we fall to our knees \\
        As we humbly proclaim \\
        You are amazing, God
    \end{songframe}


    \begin{songframe}{v2a}
        Who has told ev'ry lightning bolt where it should go \\
        Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow \\
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{v2b}
        Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light \\
        Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night \\
        None can fathom
    \end{songframe}


    \begin{songframe}{ch2a}
        Indescribable uncontainable \\
        You placed the stars in the sky \\
        And You know them by name \\
        You are amazing, God
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{ch2b}
        Incomparable unchangeable \\
        You see the depths of my heart \\
        And You love me the same \\
        You are amazing, God
    \end{songframe}


    \begin{songframe}{out}
        You see the depths of my heart \\
        And You love me the same \\
        You are amazing, God
    \end{songframe}
