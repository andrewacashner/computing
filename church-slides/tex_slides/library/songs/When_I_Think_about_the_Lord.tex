    \begin{songframe}{v1}
        When I think about the Lord \\
        How He saved me, how He raised me \\
        How He filled me with the Holy Ghost \\
        How He healed me to the uttermost
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{v2}
        When I think about the Lord \\
        How He picked me up and turned me around \\
        How He placed my feet on solid ground \\
        It makes me wanna shout
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{ch1}
        Hallelujah thank You Jesus \\
        Lord You're worthy of all the glory \\
        And all the honor and all the praise \\
        It makes me wanna shout
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{ch2}
        Hallelujah thank You Jesus \\
        Lord You're worthy of all the glory \\
        And all the honor and all the praise
    \end{songframe}
