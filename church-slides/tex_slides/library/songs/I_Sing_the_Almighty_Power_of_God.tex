\begin{song}{I Sing the Almighty Power of God}

    \begin{songframe}{v1a}
        I sing the almighty power of God, \\
        that made the mountains rise, \\
        that spread the flowing seas abroad, \\
        and built the lofty skies.
    \end{songframe}
       
    \begin{songframe}{v1b}
        I sing the wisdom that ordained \\
        the sun to rule the day; \\
        the moon shines full at God's command, \\
        and all the stars obey.
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{v2a}
        I sing the goodness of the Lord, \\
        who filled the earth with food, \\
        who formed the creatures through the Word, \\
        and then pronounced them good.
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{v2b}
        Lord, how thy wonders are display, \\
        where'er I turn my eye, \\
        if I survey the ground I tread, \\
        or gaze upon the sky.
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{v3a}
        There's not a plant or flower below, \\
        but makes thy glories known, \\
        and clouds arise, and tempests blow, \\
        by order from thy throne;
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{v3b}
        while all that borrows life from thee \\
        is ever in thy care; \\
        and everywhere that we can be, \\
        thou, God, art present there.
    \end{songframe}
