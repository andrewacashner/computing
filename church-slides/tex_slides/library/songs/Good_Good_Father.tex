    \begin{songframe}{v1}
    I've heard a thousand stories \\
    Of what they think You’re like \\
    But I've heard the tender whisper \\
    Of love in the dead of night \\
    You tell me that You’re pleased \\
    And that I'm never alone
    \end{songframe}


    \begin{songframe}{ch}
    You're a Good Good Father \\
    It's who You are \\
    It's who You are \\
    It's who You are

    And I'm loved by You \\
    It's who I am \\
    It's who I am \\
    It's who I am
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{v2}
    I've seen many searching for answers \\
    Far and wide \\
    But I know we're all searching for answers \\
    Only You provide \\
    Because You know just what we need \\
    Before we say a word
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{br}
    You are perfect in all of Your ways \\
    You are perfect in all of Your ways \\
    You are perfect in all of Your ways to us
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{v3}
    Love so undeniable I can hardly speak \\
    Peace so unexplainable I can hardly think \\
    As You call me deeper still \\
    As You call me deeper still \\
    As You call me deeper still \\
    Into love love love
    \end{songframe}
