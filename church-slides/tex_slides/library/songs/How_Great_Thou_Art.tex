    \begin{songframe}{v1}
        O Lord my God \\
        When I in awesome wonder \\
        Consider all the worlds \\
        Thy hands have made

        I see the stars \\
        I hear the rolling thunder \\
        Thy power throughout \\
        The universe displayed
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{ch}
        Then sings my soul \\
        My Savior God to Thee \\
        How great Thou art \\
        How great Thou art 

        Then sings my soul \\
        My Savior God to Thee \\
        How great Thou art \\
        How great Thou art
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{v2}
        When through the woods \\
        And forest glades I wander \\
        And hear the birds \\
        Sing sweetly in the trees

        When I look down \\
        From lofty mountain grandeur \\
        And hear the brook \\
        And feel the gentle breeze
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{v3}
        And when I think \\
        That God His Son not sparing \\
        Sent Him to die \\
        I scarce can take it in

        That on the cross \\
        My burden gladly bearing \\
        He bled and died \\
        To take away my sin
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{v4}
        When Christ shall come \\
        With shout of acclamation \\
        And take me home \\
        What joy shall fill my heart

        Then I shall bow \\
        In humble adoration \\
        And there proclaim \\
        My God how great Thou art
    \end{songframe}
