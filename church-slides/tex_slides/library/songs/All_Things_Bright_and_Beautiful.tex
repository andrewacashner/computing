\begin{song}{All Things Bright and Beautiful}
    \begin{songframe}{ch}
        All things bright and beautiful, \\
        all creatures great and small, \\
        alll things wise and wonderful: \\
        the Lord God made them all.
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{v1}
        Each little flower that opens, \\
        each little bird that sings, \\
        God made their glowing colors, \\
        and made their tiny wings.
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{v2}
        The purple-headed mountains, \\
        the river running by, \\
        the sunset and the morning \\
        that brightens up the sky.
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{v3}
        The cold wind in the winter, \\
        the pleasant summer sun, \\
        the ripe fruits in the garden: \\
        God made them, every one.
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{v4}
        God gave us eyes to see them, \\
        and lips that we might tell \\
        how great is God Almighty, \\
        who has made all things well.
