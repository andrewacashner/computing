        Our Father everlasting \\
        The all creating One \\
        God Almighty  
        
        Through Your Holy Spirit \\
        Conceiving Christ the Son \\
        Jesus our Savior
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{ch1}
        I believe in God our Father \\
        I believe in Christ the Son \\
        I believe in the Holy Spirit \\
        Our God is three in One
        
        I believe in the resurrection \\
        That we will rise again \\
        For I believe in the Name of Jesus

    \begin{songframe}{v2}
        Our judge and our defender \\
        Suffered and crucified \\
        Forgiveness is in You
        
        Descended into darkness \\
        You rose in glorious life \\
        Forever seated high
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{br}
        I believe in You \\
        I believe You rose again \\
        I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{ch2}
        I believe in life eternal \\
        I believe in the virgin birth \\
        I believe in the saints' communion \\
        And in Your holy Church
        
        I believe in the resurrection \\
        When Jesus comes again \\
        For I believe in the Name of Jesus
