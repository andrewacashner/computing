\begin{song}{Worth}

    \begin{songframe}{ch1a}
        You thought I was worth saving \\
        So You came and changed my life 

        You thought I was worth keeping \\
        So You cleaned me up inside
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{ch1b}
        You thought I was to die for \\
        So You sacrificed Your life

        So I could be free so I could be whole \\
        So I can tell everyone I know
    \end{songframe}

    \begin{songframe}{ch2}
        Hallelujah \\
        Glory to the God who changed my life \\
        Forever forever forever

        Because I am free because I am whole \\
        And I will tell everyone I know
    \end{songframe}
