# His Eye Is on the Sparrow 

| Why should my heart feel lonely
| and long for heaven and home?

-------------------------------

| When Jesus is my portion,
| my only friend indeed.
| His eye is on the sparrow,
| and I know he's watching me.

-------------------------------

| I sing because I'm happy
| I sing because I'm free

| His eye is on the sparrow,
| and I know he's watching me.
