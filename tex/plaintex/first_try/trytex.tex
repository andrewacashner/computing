``Question?'' ``Answer---yes.''
We may now begin to try {\it italic} and {\bf boldface} and {\tt typewriter} styles.
Now we go on to try accents in Spanish like {\it esdr\'ujulo} or diacritics like the German {\it Ges\"ange}.

\beginsection Music Symbols 

We might try writing a B$\flat$ in F major or a B$\natural$ in G major.
Either way, the first note is $\Gamma$.

\bye
