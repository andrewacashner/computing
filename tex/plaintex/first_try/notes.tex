\beginsection Using Plain TeX for Notes

This is a test of using Knuth's original Plain TeX for typesetting simple notes.
I can write short lines.
I can write exceedingly long lines, such as the one currently being written, and soon about to be completed---and now finished.

I can write accent marks with \TeX macros like {\it esdr\'ujulo}.
I'm sure other formatting is also possible.
