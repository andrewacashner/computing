\verse 1 Come, bless the \Lord !
\verse 2 Come, all you servants of the \Lord,
who stand by night in the house of the \Lord.

\title{Psalm 23}

{\poem
\verse 1 The \Lord\ is my shepherd, I shall not want.
\verse 2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: 
he leadeth me beside the still waters.
\verse 3 He restoreth my soul: 
he leadeth me in paths of righteousness for his names' sake.
\verse 4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, 
I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; 
thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
\verse 5 Though preparest a table before me 
in the presence of mine enemies: 
thou anointest my head with oil; 
my cup runneth over.
\verse 6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, 
and I will dwell in the house of the \Lord\ forever.
