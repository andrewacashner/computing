/**
 * Musarithmetic: A Musical Interval Calculator
 * <p>
 * The musarithmetic package provides a way to do simple calculations with
 * musical pitches and intervals.
 * (<em>Musarithmos</em> is a term coined by Athanasius Kircher in 1650 from
 * the combination of <em>music</em> and <em>arithmos</em> or number.)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A Pitch object contains a pitch name, accidental, and octave number.
 * An Interval object contains a degree (diatonic steps of the interval) and
 * a quality (such as major or diminished).
 * A Pitch plus an Interval returns a new Pitch.
