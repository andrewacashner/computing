# Top-Level Header

All I do is type and add minimal markup commands when needed.
I am writing new sentences on new lines but that's not required.

A blank line makes a new paragraph.
I use single asterisks for *emphasis* which will be put in italic.
I use double asterisks for **bold**.
I can just use regular quotation marks like "this" for quotes.
For fragments of code (to be set in typewriter/monospace font), I can use two backticks like `this`.

## Second-level header for subsection

Note the number of pound sign indicates the hierarchical level.

Let's make some lists.

Here is a bullet list, preceded by a blank line:

* Thing one
* Thing two

Indenting by four spaces gives a sublist.

* Spanish
    - Uno
    - Dos
* German
    - Eins
    - Zwei

I can number a list manually:

1. First
2. Second

Or I can do it automatically:

#. First
#. Second


### Tables

For tables, I just type in the info spaced out in a way that I like.
Above (and optionally also below) the table I write a series of dashes to show where the columns are.

Composer              Opera
--------------------  -----------------------
Jean-Philippe Rameau  *Hippolyte et Aricie*
Richard Wagner        *Götterdämmerung*

### Block quotations

Let's make a long quotation:

> That all-too familiar, but never *too* familiar,
> dialogue, we conceptualized as a means of dialogue...

### Verse or line blocks

Here is the beginning of a villancico by Joan Cererols:

| Suspended, cielos, vuestro dulce canto.
| Tened, parad, y escuchad 
| la más nueva consonancia
| que forman en su distancia
| lo eterno y lo temporal.

And here is an address:

| Joan Cererols, OSB
| Abbey of Our Lady of Montserrat
| Montserrat, Catalonia
| Crown of Aragon


## Links

If I want to link to something on the web, I put the link text in square brackets,
followed by the link URL in parentheses, like this [example](http://www.example.com).
I can also follow the link text with a number in square brackets and then put the URL 
later, such as at the bottom of the page, like this [example][1].

[1]: http://www.example.com

I can also link to another section in the document.
To do that I can use an auto-generated URL for the header or make my own.
If the header is "Final Thoughts", the auto-generated URL will be `#final-thoughts`, and I would
link like [this](#final-thoughts).

Here we go.

## Final Thoughts

Another option is to define my own shortcut for the section URL like [this](#conclusion).

## Really Final Thoughts {#conclusion}

Then we can convert to a variety of formats like HTML or LaTeX.
