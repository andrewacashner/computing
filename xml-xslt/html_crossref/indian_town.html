        At the entrance to the University of Rochester’s main campus, there
        used to be a historical marker with the heading <q>INDIAN TOWN</q> 
        (<a class="ref" data-type="figure" href="#fig:indian_town_sign">figure</a>).
        The legend explained:
        <q>IN PRIMITIVE WILDERNESS HERE WAS A LARGE ALGONKIN VILLAGE WHOSE BARK
          CABINS AND TILLED FIELDS COVERED NINE ACRES</q>.
        For those who stopped to read it the sign could evoke mystery.
        The legend invited readers to re-envision this western New York campus
        around them, erasing its quadrangles of brick Georgian Revival
        buildings, its famed optics research laboratories, its Greek temple of
        a library with its massive carillon tower—imagining this land on a bend
        in the Genesee River as <q>primitive wilderness</q> populated by some
        ancient people, the <q>Algonkins</q>.
        But what happened to these people or their village such that this sign
        was all that remained to remember them?
