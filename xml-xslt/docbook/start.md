# Abstract

This is an article with sections, including different kinds of floats and
whatnot with cross references and bibliography.

# Introduction

This is the introduction. It will not remind you of the preface to
*Moby-Dick*. Or perhaps it will. "Call me a document" [@Kircher:Musurgia, 1].
It's up to you.^[Follow the hermeneutic circle all the way to the end.]

What you'll see when you look at [figure X](#fig:squares) is a lot of squares.
They're all nested inside each other and get infinitely smaller.
I made it in LaTeX using a loop. You'll find it is different from what I will
show you in [section X](#sec:next).

# Next part {#sec:next}

What's different about these squares from the next thing I'll talk about is
that next thing isn't squares at all. It's notated music ([example
\ref{ex:crotchets}](#ex:crotchets)). It shows *crotchets*, which is the British term for quarter
notes, I think. Anyway, Benjamin Britten in *Billy Budd* would like you to
make sure they keep "gently flowing." They don't have anything to do with
*crocheting*, which is a handicraft not frequently featured in British
opera.^[But why not?]
