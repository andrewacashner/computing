# Abstract

This is an article with sections, including different kinds of floats and
whatnot with cross references and bibliography.

# Introduction

This is the introduction. It will not remind you of the preface to
*Moby-Dick*. 
Or perhaps it will. 
"Call me a document" [@Kircher:Musurgia, 1].
It's up to you.^[Follow the hermeneutic circle all the way to the end.]

<!-- figlabel(FIGsquares) -->
What you'll see when you look at figref(FIGsquares) is a lot of squares.
They're all nested inside each other and get infinitely smaller.
I made it in LaTeX using a loop. 
<!-- seclabel(SECnext) -->
You'll find it is different from what I will show you in secref(SECnext).

# Secref(SECnext). Next part 

What's different about these squares from the next thing I'll talk about is
that next thing isn't squares at all. 
<!-- muslabel(MUScrotchets) -->
It's notated music (musref(MUScrotchets)). 
It shows *crotchets*, which is the British term for quarter notes, I think. 
Anyway, Benjamin Britten in *Billy Budd* would like you to make sure they keep
"gently flowing." 
They don't have anything to do with *crocheting*, which is a handicraft not
frequently featured in British opera.^[But why not?]
